# Federated Learning with Edge Intelligence in Smart Healthcare

## üìå Project Overview
This project explores the integration of **Federated Learning (FL)** and **Edge Intelligence** to enhance data refinement and improve the accuracy of global models in smart healthcare systems. By training models locally on edge devices, we ensure data privacy and leverage distributed data sources to create robust global models applicable to various healthcare challenges.

## üõ† Tech Stack & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Techniques Implemented:**
  - Federated Averaging (**FedAvg**)
  - Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (**FedSGD**)
- **Dataset:** MHEALTH (Mobile Health) Dataset

## üìä Dataset Details
The **MHEALTH (Mobile Health) Dataset** comprises body motion and vital signs recordings from ten volunteers of diverse profiles performing various physical activities. Sensors placed on the chest, right wrist, and left ankle measured motion (acceleration, rate of turn, magnetic field orientation) and 2-lead ECG measurements. This dataset is instrumental in human behavior analysis based on multimodal body sensing.

## üöÄ Features & Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Standardized and normalized sensor data.
  - Addressed class imbalances to enhance model accuracy.
- **Local Model Training:**
  - Implemented algorithms to train models on edge devices, ensuring data remains local to preserve privacy.
- **Federated Learning Techniques:**
  - Integrated **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)** to aggregate local models into a global model.
  - Applied **Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedSGD)** for model updates.
- **Edge Intelligence:**
  - Leveraged edge computing resources to process data closer to the source, reducing latency and bandwidth usage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps
1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Downloaded the MHEALTH dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mhealth+dataset).
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
   - Standardized features and addressed class imbalances.
3. **Local Model Training:**
   - Distributed data across simulated edge devices.
   - Trained local models using TensorFlow.
4. **Federated Aggregation:**
   - Applied FedAvg and FedSGD to combine local models into a global model.
5. **Evaluation:**
   - Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## üìà Performance Benchmarks
- **Federated Averaging (FedAvg):** Achieved a global model accuracy of **93%**.
- **Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedSGD):** Achieved a global model accuracy of **95%**.

## üîç Model Output
The global model provides:
- **Predictions:** Classifies physical activities based on sensor data.
- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualizations:** Training and validation loss curves, confusion matrices.
